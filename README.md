# Advice WEB Application
This simple app provides tips. There is one button per page for refreshing advices. The application also has a contrasting background and in the future it is planned to add an atmospheric audio sheet.

# Code
The code is quite simple and small. A random advice generator was taken as a basis, and then everything was built around it (background, styles, buttons).


# Potential
This app is primarily designed for motivation. In my opinion, the idea is simple, but the effect on people should be tangible.
